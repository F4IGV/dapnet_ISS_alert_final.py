ISS DAPNET Alert Script

By F4IGV and ChatGPT
ASCII only - POCSAG compatible

This project provides a full Python script that detects upcoming ISS passes and sends real time alerts through the DAPNET pager network.
The script uses Skyfield for orbital calculations, stores all events in UTC, and generates DAPNET messages in local time.

It is designed for amateur radio operators who want to receive ISS alerts directly on their POCSAG pagers via DAPNET.

Features

Automatic download of ISS TLE data (AMSAT + Celestrak)

Pass prediction for the next 2 hours

Detection of 4 main events:

Prealert (15 min before rise)

Start of visibility

Peak (maximum elevation)

End of pass

Real time azimuth and elevation calculation for each event

Fully ASCII messages for POCSAG compatibility

JSON state file prevents duplicate alerts

Auto reset after each completed pass

Detailed local and UTC logging

Fully autonomous when run every minute

Message format

Prealert:

ISS dans 15 min HH:MM - Azimut X


Start / Peak / End:

ISS visible HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y
ISS zenith HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y
ISS fin HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y


All times shown in messages are local time.
All calculations and storage are done in UTC.

Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository

2. Install Python 3

Python 3.8 or newer is required.

Check your version:

python --version

3. Install required packages
pip install requests skyfield

4. Configure DAPNET settings

Edit the script and update:

DAPNET_USER = "YourCall"
DAPNET_PASS = "YourPassword"
CALLSIGNS = ["Call1", "Call2"]
TX_GROUP   = "YourTxGroup"

5. Set observer location

Edit:

LAT = 48.1173
LON = -1.6778
ALT = 60

6. First manual test
python iss_alert.py

7. Schedule automatic execution
Linux (cron)
* * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/iss_alert.py

Windows Task Scheduler

Create a new task

Trigger: run every 1 minute

Action:

Program: python.exe

Arguments: path to iss_alert.py

Set Start in to the script directory

How it works

Script loads or initializes the state file

Downloads latest TLE data

Predicts the next ISS pass

Each run checks if current time matches prealert/start/peak/end window

If match -> compute az/ele and send a DAPNET alert

Logs all actions

Pass is cleared after end + expiration time

The script is designed to be fully autonomous and safe to run repeatedly.

Project structure
iss_alert.py        # Main script
iss_state.json      # Autogenerated - keeps track of current pass
iss_debug.log       # Autogenerated - detailed debug log
README.md           # Documentation

Requirements

Python 3.8+

requests

skyfield

Install dependencies:

pip install requests skyfield

Troubleshooting

No messages sent

Check TLE download logs

Check DAPNET credentials

Ensure script runs once per minute

Duplicate messages

Delete iss_state.json and restart

Wrong times

Ensure system clock is synced (NTP recommended)
