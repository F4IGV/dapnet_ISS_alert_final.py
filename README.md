ISS DAPNET Alert Script

By F4IGV and ChatGPT
ASCII only - POCSAG compatible

This project provides a full Python script that detects upcoming ISS passes and sends real time alerts through the DAPNET pager network.
The script uses Skyfield for orbital calculations, stores all events in UTC, and generates DAPNET messages in local time.

It is designed for amateur radio operators who want to receive ISS alerts directly on their POCSAG pagers via DAPNET.

Features

Automatic download of ISS TLE data (AMSAT + Celestrak)

Pass prediction for the next 2 hours

Detection of 4 main events:

Prealert (15 min before rise)

Start of visibility

Peak (maximum elevation)

End of pass

Real time azimuth and elevation calculation for each event

Fully ASCII messages for POCSAG compatibility

JSON state file prevents duplicate alerts

Auto reset after each completed pass

Detailed local and UTC logging

Can be invoked manually or from an external scheduler

Message format
Prealert
ISS dans 15 min HH:MM - Azimut X

Start / Peak / End
ISS visible HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y
ISS zenith HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y
ISS fin HH:MM - Azimut X Elevation Y


All message times are local.
All internal calculations and storage use UTC to prevent drift.

Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository

2. Install Python 3

Python 3.8 or newer is recommended.

Check your version:

python --version

3. Install required Python packages
pip install requests skyfield

4. Configure DAPNET credentials

Edit the script and update:

DAPNET_USER = "YourCall"
DAPNET_PASS = "YourPassword"
CALLSIGNS = ["Call1", "Call2"]
TX_GROUP   = "YourTxGroup"

5. Configure observer location

Set your QTH:

LAT = 48.1173
LON = -1.6778
ALT = 60

6. First manual execution
python iss_alert.py


This creates:

iss_state.json
iss_debug.log

How it works

Script loads or initializes the state file

Downloads latest ISS TLE data

Predicts the next ISS pass within a 2 hour window

On each execution, checks whether the current time matches one of the pass events

If a window matches, the script computes azimuth/elevation and sends a DAPNET alert

State prevents duplicate alerts

Pass resets automatically after completion

You may run the script manually or through any external automation system of your choice.

Project structure
iss_alert.py        # Main script
iss_state.json      # Autogenerated - tracks current pass
iss_debug.log       # Autogenerated - debug log

Requirements

Python 3.8+

requests

skyfield

Install dependencies:

pip install requests skyfield

Troubleshooting

No messages sent

Verify DAPNET credentials

Check TLE logs for errors

Ensure network connectivity

Wrong azimuth/elevation

Verify QTH coordinates

Duplicate messages

Delete iss_state.json and re-run

Script exits with TLE error

AMSAT or Celestrak may be temporarily unavailable

Try again later
